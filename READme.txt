Movie Recommendation System Documentation
1. Overview
The Movie Recommendation System is designed to deliver personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences. It processes a dataset containing details like movie titles, overviews, and genres to generate recommendations.

2. Dependencies
The system relies on the following libraries:

Pandas: For handling and analyzing data.
Scikit-learn: For text vectorization and calculating similarity scores using cosine similarity.
3. Features
Core Functionality:
Data Loading: Reads a movie dataset from a CSV file.
Data Exploration: Summarizes dataset statistics, checks for missing values, and displays column details.
Feature Selection: Extracts key features such as id, title, overview, and genre, merging them into a single feature, tags.
Text Vectorization: Converts text data into numerical vectors using the CountVectorizer tool.
Cosine Similarity: Calculates similarity between movies by comparing their vectorized text data.
Recommendation: Recommends movies similar to the user-provided input based on cosine similarity scores.
4. Usage
To utilize the system:

Load Data: Use the load_data function to import a movie dataset from a CSV file.
Explore Data: Analyze the dataset using the data_exploration function.
Feature Selection: Prepare the dataset by selecting and merging relevant features with the feature_selection function.
Vectorize Text: Convert text features into vectors using the text_vectorization function.
Compute Similarity: Calculate cosine similarity between vectors with the compute_similarity function.
Generate Recommendations: Use the recommend_movies function to suggest movies based on a given title.
5. Development Process
The system was built following these steps:

Load the dataset and analyze its structure.
Identify and combine relevant features into a tags column.
Vectorize text data using CountVectorizer.
Measure similarity between movies using cosine similarity scores.
Accept a movie title as input and generate recommendations based on the similarity scores.
6. Future Enhancements
To improve the system, the following updates can be considered:

Collaborative Filtering: Implement user-based or item-based approaches for more personalized recommendations.
Additional Features: Incorporate attributes such as actors, directors, and release years to refine recommendation accuracy.
